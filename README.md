# OnlineFraudDetection
Overview
The Online Fraud Detection project aims to identify and prevent fraudulent activities in online transactions by leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analytics. The system analyzes transaction patterns and flags suspicious behavior to mitigate risks.
Features
Real-time detection of fraudulent transactions
Analysis of historical transaction data for anomaly detection
Machine learning algorithms for classification (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks)
User-friendly interface for monitoring flagged transactions
Secure and scalable backend for large datasets
Dataset
The project uses the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (or any similar dataset).
Ensure the dataset contains features like transaction amount, time, and anonymized fields for analysis.Machine Learning Workflow
Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values and outliers.
Normalize and scale data.
Feature Selection

Select important features using correlation analysis or feature importance scores.
Model Training

Train models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks.
Evaluate performance using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Fraud Detection

Predict fraudulent transactions in real time or batch processing.
